title: Interview Sign-up Survey
subtitle: Student Experiences and Perspectives on Learning to Code in 2024
date: 2024-09
abstract: |
    This is the survey disseminated in September 2024, aiming to attract undergraduate physics students to put themselves forward for interview. The original survey was a [Jisc Online Surveys v3](https://onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/) survey, and has been converted to markdown format here. The Jisc survey was also directly exported to both PDF and JSON formats (the latter can be used to recreate the survey), which are available under 'Other Links' on the right navigation panel.

## Experiences of learning to code

Please complete this short survey to help us understand the range of experiences and perspectives of physics students at the University.

If you would be willing to share your perspectives in an informal interview (for which you would be reimbursed for your time), there is the option to register your interest on the final page.

### About this study

We are a group of researchers, including two recent graduates and a current MSc student based in the School of Physics and Astronomy.

We are interested in hearing about people's experiences of learning to code, developing as a programmer, and taking programming courses as part of a physics degree.

That is why we are looking for students who are willing to take part in an informal ~45 minute interview over Microsoft Teams to share their experiences and perspectives.

### Safeguarding your privacy

The sole purpose of this study is research. Participating will have no effect whatsoever on your grades.

We have strict protocols in place to ensure that any information provided to us in this form, or in interviews, is done so with complete confidentiality. That means no identifiable information about you will ever be shared with any teaching staff. Our methodology has been approved by the School's ethics officer.

If you are selected for an interview, we will provide further details on how your privacy will be protected during the interview process.

### I'm not interested in being interviewed!

That's ok! You can still take part in the study and help us out by completing the 3 minute survey on the next page.

We are grateful for any time you can spare to contribute to this research!

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | -------------- |
| I enjoy programming.                                                                                                                   |                   |          |         |       |                |
| Programming is likely to be important to my career.                                                                                    |                   |          |         |       |                |
| I enjoy taking the time to improve my code, even if it is already working and I would be unlikely to gain further marks from doing so. |                   |          |         |       |                |
| I sometimes feel anxious about asking for help with programming issues.                                                                |                   |          |         |       |                |

| I am not satisfied unless I understand what every single line or function is doing.                                                    |                   |          |         |       |                |
| I often feel creative when I am programming.                                                                                           |                   |          |         |       |                |
| I enjoy taking on challenging programming problems.                                                                                    |                   |          |         |       |                |
| I am proud of some of the code I have written.                                                                                         |                   |          |         |       |                |
