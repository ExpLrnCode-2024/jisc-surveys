# Jisc surveys

This repository contains the [Jisc](https://onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/) surveys created for the [Experiences of Learning to Code](https://github.com/ExpLrnCode-2024) project.

There are two surveys:

1. `survey.{md,pdf,json}`: a survey disseminated among students in September 2024, primarily intended for recruiting potential interviewees.

2. `participant_info.{md,pdf,json}`: a survey containing both the _participant information sheet_ and the _informed consent form_. Students were required to complete this survey prior to their interview commencing.

Both surveys are provided in three forms:

1. `.md`: A markdown document.

2. `.pdf`: A PDF produced from the original survey using Jisc's 'export' function.

3. `.json`: A JSON file produced from the original survey using Jisc's 'export' function. This can be directly loaded into Jisc to recreate the survey.

The most convenient way to view these surveys is through the following URLs, which like to the GitHub Pages site:
